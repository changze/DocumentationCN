# Remote Access Sometimes you need access to a Raspberry Pi without connecting a monitor to it: for example, if the Pi is embedded in something like a robot; if you want to view some information from it from elsewhere; or maybe if you just don't have a monitor spare! 

## Contents

*   [Access over Internet][1] 
    *   Remote access to the Pi over the Internet
*   [VNC][2] 
    *   Remote access to the Pi's graphical interface, viewed in a window on another computer
*   [SSH][3] 
    *   Access the command line of the Pi from another computer
*   [FTP][4] 
    *   Copy files between your Pi and another computer using FTP
*   [SFTP][5] 
    *   Copy files between your Pi and another computer using SFTP (more secure than FTP)
*   [SCP][6] 
    *   Copy files between your Pi and another computer using SCP (more secure than FTP)
*   [rsync][7] 
    *   Synchronise folders between the Pi and another computer using `rsync` over SSH
*   [Web Server][8] 
    *   Set up a website or a web page to display some information about the Pi, using a web browser on another machine, on the network, or on the internet
