最近写东西，在保存数据时总是中文插入乱码，后来 一路 Debug，追查源码各种查看，实在无解，因为整个数据保存各个环节输出都没有出现乱码，以为是JDBC 驱动不兼容的问题，换了依旧不行，最后确定是 Mysql 数据库的编码不都是UTF-8格式，所以改变 Mysql 配置文件才解决，虽然问题最终很好解决但其中过程让我痛苦很久。。。。 为了解决问题把Mysql数据库换成 Mariadb 数据库的时候，竟然造成冲突，又误删 ubuntu系统的 /var/lib/dpkg/info 文件夹，这可惨了（修复若干小时。。），然后 下载ubuntu最新镜像刻录然后进upan系统，把对应u盘系统内的文件复制到误删系统内，才不至于冲突，但依旧

# Mysql字符编码设置

1.  查看Mysql字符默认设置， `mysql root@localhost:training> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'char%';
+--------------------------+----------------------------+
| Variable_name            | Value                      |
|--------------------------+----------------------------|
| character_set_client     | utf8                       |
| character_set_connection | utf8                       |
| character_set_database   | utf8                       |
| character_set_filesystem | binary                     |
| character_set_results    | utf8                       |
| character_set_server     | utf8                       |
| character_set_system     | utf8                       |
| character_sets_dir       | /usr/share/mysql/charsets/ |
+--------------------------+----------------------------+
8 rows in set
Time: 0.005s
mysql root@localhost:training>` 

凑活看，排版搞不定，呃呃呃。 如果出现非 utf-8编码的字段，请看如下配置

    cd /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/
    vim  mysqld.cnf 
    

`接下来 插图时刻，`[<img src="https://www.rpicn.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/snapshot3-257x300.png" alt="snapshot3" width="257" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-661" />][1] 在 `mysqld`字段 添加 `character-set-server=utf8` 然后在当前目录执行`vim    ../conf.d/mysql.cnf` 在其中添加 `[mysql]` `default-character-set=utf8` ，然后`sudo  service mysql stop` `sudo  service mysql start`，OK现在 在数据库中查看 编码，看有没有其他地方不是utf-8编码 `SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'char%';`

* * *

## **然后好吧，就这样，被这个问题搞得好烦， 修复系统去了。。。。**
